Tasks I - EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

The goal is to analyze the experimentâ€™s performance by understanding the dataset. The workflow includes:

    Dataset Exploration: Use Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to examine the dataset's structure and clean any issues.
    Client Behavior Analysis:
        Identify the primary users of the online process.
        Determine whether users are younger or older, new or long-standing.
        Conduct further analysis to uncover additional behavioral insights.

Tasks II - KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)

Define success metrics for the new design by evaluating:

    Completion Rate: Percentage of users who complete the process.
    Time Spent on Each Step: Average duration per step.
    Error Rates: Frequency of users navigating backward, indicating confusion or issues.
    Additional KPIs: Identify any other relevant performance indicators.
